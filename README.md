# UFOs

## Overview of Project
THe purpose of this analysis was to assist Dana in creating an interactive dashboard where the user can review the UFO data. Dana wanted the users to be able to parse the data around UFO sightings and view the data and table that presented the data. This process included linking multiple items to one another: a HTML file, JavaScript Files, an image, and a CSS style sheet. 

## Results

Table that allows the user to filter through the data:

Filtering the data in the table allows the user to view based on a criteria that shows the city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments of the sighting. 

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the user would need to know some form of criteria in order to get the search to run, like the city. 
One suggestion would be to upgrade the table filtering to allow date ranges or geographical ranges that the user can search by if they do not know specifics. Another suggestion would be to add filtering capabilities like time range or duration, so users could search by that to see any trends in the length of sightings.
